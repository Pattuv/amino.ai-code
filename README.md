**This is strictly a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate the capability of artificial intelligence for codon optimization. Use of this tool in professional or laboratory settings is not recommended.**

### **Why did I make this project?**

I’ve always been drawn to natural science- and in my opinion, biology is the most natural science there is. I think biology was just boring for me in my freshman year of high school, which is why I didn’t go all in. I’ll be honest: I will definitely not try to major in biology in the future, but biotechnology intersects with my interests in the human body as well as my aptitude for computer science. My cohesive story is that though I've done things in many fields, they've always tied back to CS.  I hope that I will be able to do great things with these skills.

Although most of my work ties back to computer science, I’m not looking to stay behind a screen forever. I want to step into the wet lab, learn how the machines work, master the micropipette, and create things that have tangible, biological results. Computer science has one major caveat: everything you build has no physical form. **I want to change that — to write code that doesn’t just exist, but *lives*.**

**Note: For the sake of this project (and my sanity), we’re “optimizing” proteins based on only three out of a plethora of biological factors:**

</aside>

1. **Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)** – how closely the gene sequence matches the preferred codons of the target organism.
2. **GC Content** – the proportion of guanine–cytosine base pairs, which influences DNA/RNA stability and expression efficiency.
3.  **Randomization of Synonymous Codons** – breaking exact repeat patterns to prevent cloning and expression issues while maintaining high translation efficiency.

These three parameters form a simplified baseline for a proof-of-concept tool, demonstrating how AI could assist codon optimization. Future iterations could incorporate deeper biological features like mRNA structure, translation kinetics, and host-specific regulatory motifs for higher fidelity.
